For this day I selected plain old bash file because it was the first thing that came to mind and it was easy to set up (thanks to `pkgs.writeShellApplication`), but after I was done, I felt really dirty.

But the thing is, it IS really dirty.
I just said "everything that is available, I can use" -- and it was way too much.
Even `awk` was available.
Thankfully, I at least had the dignity to not use that.
