Today was way nicer than yesterday. I think, mostly because I felt not so dirty for just abusing every thing that was available to me. This challenge I just did everything with pure fish builtins. I think.

Only thing I missed were booleans. Are there booleans? There might be, maybe I just assumed there weren't. Still, I think my `is_{inc,dec}reasing` check was slick.
